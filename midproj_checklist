• Is your name on the page?
• Is your picture on the page?
• Is there a 'good' introduction of you?
• Do you have at least a table, frames and images?

Please put at least two additional features that you 
feel appropriate. Indicate all these things clearly.

You should only submit the URL of your home page 
via the Blackboard at Week 7. You can upload a 
readme.txt file including the URL and any points you 
would like the examiner to be aware of. The URL must 
under the page of department of computing or a
public server; that is, it must be of the type: 
www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~yourid. Please don’t hand 
in any assignment by email.
❖ The purpose of the assignment is to show your 
knowledge of HTML and CSS (including some 
advanced techniques) by creating and designing your 
own home page.
